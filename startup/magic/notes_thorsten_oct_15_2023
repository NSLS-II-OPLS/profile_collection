Subject: bluesky magic commands
 

Hello Ben,
Linus helped me to set the gitlab visibility of the project
to public. You should now be able to see this:

https://gitlab.desy.de/fs-ec/blueskydesy

The magics are here:

https://gitlab.desy.de/fs-ec/blueskydesy/-/blob/main/blueskyDESY/magics.py?ref_type=heads

I implemented just a few magic commands, just to see whether I
could make the Bluesky command line look like spec or spock.

The magic commands are 'activated' for an ipython session by
editing the 00-start.py of the profile:

#
# to be executed in ~/.ipython/profile_bluesky/startup/00-start.py
#
import blueskyDESY.magics


Some details can be found here:

Regarding the blueskyDESY environment, handled by e.g. lsenv,
senv, usenv: it has been made persistent by storing the environment
dictionary as a json string in a memorized attribute of a Tango server.

Best regards, Thorsten
